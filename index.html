<h3>I AM A CAT PERSON</h3>
<p>I love like cats. This is because cats make me feel calmer. Cats are beautiful little animals that resemble tigers. It lives on the streets as well as in my house and is one of my favorite pets. The cat's body is covered with soft, silky hair and has four short legs and sharp claws hidden in the fleshy liner. I have 7 cats in my house and I love them all!My latest pet that I have adopt is Citam because he is black.</p>

<h4>I LOVE COOKING</h4> 
<p>There are so many reasons I love to cook, cooking is one of those things that really suits me, and I think I inherit, because I can cook almost anything and try on the first try, like my grandmother. But the main reason I love cooking is because it makes me stress-free. For example while I was cooking, I did not have much time to think, because cooking challenged my mind and relieved the stress of my daily life. I know a lot of people will disagree when I say cooking is an important skill in reducing their stress levels but it works for me, but it also allows me to develop my cooking skills and make me a better cook and a great cook always trying to find new ways to make cooking fun and stimulating like me.</p>
